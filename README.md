# Material for the EGU23 Short Course 5.5: "Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python"

## Setup

### Option A (Recommended): Mybinder.org

In order to quickly get started, please **click on the following badge**:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/esciencecenter-digital-skills/2023-04-25-ds-geospatial-python-EGU.git/HEAD)

You will get access to a JupyterLab environment running on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org). 

### Option B: Google Colab

If the above Binder option does not work for you, please click on the following Colab badge:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/esciencecenter-digital-skills/2023-04-25-ds-geospatial-python-EGU/)

You can select one of the four notebooks of this course and run them in a Google Colab environment. However it has the following limitations:

1. You need a Google account
2. You need to upload the course data manually to the Colab environment. To do this, 1) download this GitHub repository as a `.zip` file, 2) unzip it locally, and 3) upload the `data` folder to the Colab environment.
3. You need to install Python dependencies manually on Colab. To do this, uncomment the first cell (with the `pip` command) in the notebook and execute it.

### Option C: local setup

The solutions described above are suitable for short sessions and demonstrations, but [resources are limited](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html)! If you want to keep experimenting with Python, we recommend to set up an environment on your computer. You can do so by [following these setup instructions](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/setup.html).

## Resources

This short course is based on the lesson [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/), which is part of [the Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org).
