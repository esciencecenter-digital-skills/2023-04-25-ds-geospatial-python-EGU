# Material for the EGU23 Short Course 5.5: "Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python"

## Setup

In order to quickly get started, please **click on the following badge**:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/esciencecenter-digital-skills/2023-04-25-ds-geospatial-python-EGU.git/HEAD)

You will get access to a JupyterLab environment running on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org). 

This environment is suitable for short sessions and demonstrations, but [resources are limited](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html)! If you want to keep experimenting with Python, we recommend to set up an analogous environment on your computer, and you can do so by [following these setup instructions](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/setup.html).

## Resources

This short course is based on the lesson [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/), which is part of [the Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org).
